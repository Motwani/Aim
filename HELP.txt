The Targets themselves have different shapes and sizes and are spawned after an interval of time.

There are two barriers that bock the bullet from the targets and reflect the ball back.

Collisions, Gravity , Projectile Motion are implemented.

Makefile has been included in the source. The command to run is

g++ -o Aim game.cpp glad.c -lGL -lglfw -L/usr/local/lib -ldl
